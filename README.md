The goal of this assignment was to count the number of falling-edge transitions that occur on P3.3 on an MSP432 microcontroller generated by an active-low sensor input connected to P3.3. P4.0 is configured as an output and then connected using a shunt on P3.3 so that P4.0 emulates the sensor output.
